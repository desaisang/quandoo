Hello,
As discussed I have uploaded the assignment code. Below is the brief description about design techniques and libraries I used in this assignment.

1. I have used MVP pattern to develop this assignment. For this I have used MOSBY library. It allowed me to create the MVP architecture
in the assignment in quick manner.
2. I used GSON library to parse JSON data from the server. 
3. As per the requirement the application had to work offline so I have stored data in database as soon as it is received from server.
